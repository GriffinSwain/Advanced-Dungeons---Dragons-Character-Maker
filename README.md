https://advanceddnd.azurewebsites.net/


This program is designed to help create a character for the First Editions of Dungeons & Dragons (Advanced Dungeons & Dragons)
When making a character, both classes and races have stat requirements that your character must meet

There are two different choices you can make when rolling your stats:

  Roll Down: Your stats are rolled from top to bottom
  
  Stat Choice: Your stats are given to you to choose which stat you'd like to put them towards. Click the stat name you want the left most stat to go towards.
  
  
  
  3D6: Three six sided dice are rolled to determine your stat numbers
  
  4D6 - Lowest: Four six sided dice are rolled to determine your stat numbers, the lowest of the four numbers is dropped, leaving the three highest rolls.
